# SQL - DVD Rental Database Exploration

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a movie rental company's database using SQL. The goal was to run queries that uncover insights about customer behaviors, rental patterns, and store performance. Additionally, I created visualizations to represent the data findings in a clear and meaningful way.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used is the Sakila DVD Rental database, which contains information on customer demographics, rental transactions, inventory, and store operations. By querying this database, I was able to identify customer patterns across different groups, compare rental payments, and assess how individual stores performed relative to each other. A database schema (ERD) is provided for context.

- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: 
  - `dvd_rental_sample_database_diagram.png` - A visual representation of the database structure.
  
- **SQL Queries**: 
  - `project_queries.sql` - Contains the SQL queries used to analyze the dataset.
  - `project_queries.txt` - An alternative format of the same SQL queries for easy viewing.
